Retrieved from https://policyviz.com/2023/02/01/a-better-path-toward-criticizing-data-visualization/\nThe chart featured in the article “A Better Path Toward Criticizing Data Visualization” on PolicyViz showcases a comprehensive overview of the considerations when evaluating the visualizations of data. Essential criteria such as context, clarity, accuracy, and distinct dimensions are categorized in various aspects of visualizations that the chart does. For every category, there is a type of representation in key elements involved to present effective data presentation such as allowing viewers to quickly grasp that.\nVisualization underscores the importance of how it is communicated and the data itself. In presenting the interplay between different dimensions such as data integrity and visuals it serves as a tool to improve data graphics and critiques. The layout that is shown in a structured way invites viewers to consider the multifaceted nature of data visualization emphasizing that a visual that is strong must achieve informational accuracy and aesthetic appeal. While a chart effectively organizes critical elements there are also limitations such as a lack of importance of each dimension and does not quantify the weight which could guide users in prioritizing their critiques. In order to enhance understanding, examples of good versus poor visualization illustrate its points. The effectiveness of clarity can vary among audiences and contexts where the framework presented is subjective.\nOverall, this chart provides a valuable framework for encapsulating essential criteria in an accessible format and assessing data visualizations. Incorporating more detailed explanations and specific examples of the dimension’s significance could enhance fostering communication practices that are better an its utility.\n\n\nAssignment 2\n1.) Website: The Parable of Google Flu: Traps in Big Data Analysis\nPost a one-page note on your website on:\ni.Big analytics pitfall\nii.Overfitting and overparametrization\nBig data analytics has revolutionized fields such as marketing, finance, and healthcare by extracting massive datasets. This type of power comes from overparametrization and overfitting which are pitfalls. There is a need to develop robust predictive models that can benefit and generalize unseen data well. Overfitting comes into play to train data and learn outliers and noise. With underlying patterns there typically is an off ratio between complex relative data to data that is available. An overfitted model performs poorly on test sets or validation, but excellently on training data that leads to accuracy metrics that are inflated and do not accurately reflect true predictive performance. In the context of predicting influenza outbreaks a model may fit great for historical data, but cannot predict future trends due to its reliance on noise patterns that result in misguided public health responses. Overparametrization refers that there are too many parameters in the model that can lead to overfitting which leads to a risk in capturing noise and not genuine signal. In a model with a hundred parameters, this might appear as beneficial when really it is complicating the model by increasing the chances of overfitting and making it harder to interpret. To combat these issues several strategies such as feature selection, regularization, ensemble selection, and cross validation can be employed. These technqiues perform well in existing data while also generalizing effectively.\n2.) Watch: Hadley Wickham: Data Visualization and Data Science (EMBL)\nName the technologies/techniques Wickham introduced. What are his main points? Summarize and comment.\nIn Hadley Wickham’s EMBL Keynote lecture on Data Visualization and Data Science, he discuesses key techniques and technologies that are essential for effective analysis and data visualization. In the package R there is a power of ggplot2 that utilizes a grammar of graphics to layer components enabling users to create visualizations step by step. Tidyverse was also introduced in the video where a collection of R packages that are designed for data science that share philosophy design featuring tidyr for data tidying and dplyr for data manipulation. Results, narrative in a single document, and combining code are the highlighted importance of RMarkdown. A web application framework called Shiny allows users to develop interactive web apps directly from enhancing data exploration and R scripts.\nWickham outlines multiple data wrangling technqiues that are needed to prepare data for visualization and analysis stressing the necessity of well structured data that is clean. An emphasis of effective data visualization is vital for understanding communicating insights clearly and complex data. He advocates for gradually adding complexity to enhance clarity and starting with simple visualizations for a layered approach to visualization. Reproducibility is another theme that highlights the need for RMarkdown to show analyses can be shared and reproduced. Additionally, Shiny facilitates exploration and insight generation while engaging depply with data. Overall, the lecture promotes synergy between data science and data visualization and fostering practices of clear communication of results and effective analysis.\n3.)

When altering the pch it changes the points on the plotline of the graph.\nii. points (x, y1, pch=16, cex=3) # Try different cex value?\nWhen points get larger on the plot line this means that the cex value is getting larger as well. Therefore this means that the cex value changes the size of the points on the plot line.\niii. axis(1, at=seq(0, 16, 4)) # What is the first number standing for?\nThe first number standing is the x axis being generated on the chart. The x axis is labelled “Travel Time in seconds”. With the first number on the x axis being 0 this signifies the time in seconds beginning.\niiii. Figures above:\n1.
